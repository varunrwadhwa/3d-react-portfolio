Workspace: Collecting workspace information

This project appears to be a React-based portfolio website with a 3D theme, utilizing various libraries and tools such as `react-three/fiber`, `framer-motion`, and `vite` for development and deployment. Here's a breakdown of the structure and how it works:

### Project Structure

1. **Root Directory**:
    - 

package.json

: Contains project metadata, dependencies, and scripts for building and deploying the project.
    - 

vite.config.js

: Configuration file for Vite, the build tool.
    - 

postcss.config.js

: Configuration for PostCSS.
    - 

tailwind.config.js

: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
    - 

README.md

: Project documentation.
    - 

.gitignore

: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
    - 

.github

: Contains GitHub workflows for CI/CD.

2. **Public Directory**:
    - Contains static assets like images and other files that are served directly.

3. **Src Directory**:
    - 

App.jsx

: The main application component that sets up the router and includes various sections of the portfolio.
    - 

index.css

: Global CSS styles.
    - `main.jsx`: Entry point for the React application.
    - 

assets

: Contains images and other static assets used in the project.
    - `components/`: Contains React components used throughout the application.
        - 

Hero.jsx

, 

Navbar.jsx

, 

Tech.jsx

, 

Experience.jsx

, 

Project.jsx

, 

Contact.jsx

, 

Content.jsx

, 

Profile.jsx

, 

Achievement.jsx

, 

Education.jsx

, 

Footer.jsx

: Various sections of the portfolio.
        - 

canvas/

: Contains 3D canvas components.
        - `hoc/`: Higher-order components for wrapping other components.
        - 

styles.js

: Contains style-related constants.
        - `utils/`: Utility functions and constants.
    - `constants/`: Contains data and constants used in the application.
        - 

index.js

: Exports various constants and data used in the project.

### How It Works

1. **Entry Point**:
    - The application starts from `main.jsx`, which renders the 

App

 component into the root element of the HTML.

2. **App Component**:
    - The 

App

 component in 

App.jsx

 sets up the main structure of the application using React Router for navigation.
    - It includes various sections like 

Hero

, 

Navbar

, 

Content

, 

Education

, 

Experience

, 

Achievement

, 

Profile

, 

Tech

, 

Contact

, and 

Footer

.

3. **Components**:
    - Each section of the portfolio is a separate React component.
    - Components like 

Hero

, 

Navbar

, 

Tech

, etc., are imported and used in the 

App

 component.
    - The 

Project

 component displays a list of projects, which are fetched from the 

index.js

 file.

4. **Styling**:
    - The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with additional custom styles defined in 

index.css

 and component-specific SCSS files.
    - The 

styles.js

 file contains style-related constants.

5. **3D Elements**:
    - The project uses `react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for 3D elements.
    - 3D components are located in the 

canvas/

 directory and are used in various sections of the portfolio.

6. **Animations**:
    - Animations are handled using `framer-motion`.
    - Components use 

motion

 from `framer-motion` to add animations.

7. **Data**:
    - Project data, experience details, and other constants are stored in 

index.js

.
    - This data is imported and used in various components to display dynamic content.

8. **Deployment**:
    - The project uses GitHub Pages for deployment.
    - The `deploy` script in 

package.json

 builds the project and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

### Example: Project Component

The 

Project

 component displays a list of projects. Here's a simplified example of how it works:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { cProject, javaProject, webProject, otherProject } from "../constants";
import ProjectList from "./ProjectList";
import ProjectCard from "./ProjectCard";
import "./Project.scss";

const Project = () => {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState("other");
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    switch (selected) {
      case "java":
        setData(javaProject);
        break;
      case "c++":
        setData(cProject);
        break;
      case "web":
        setData(webProject);
        break;
      case "other":
        setData(otherProject);
        break;
      default:
        setData(cProject);
    }
  }, [selected]);

  return (
    <>
      <motion.div whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }} variants={textVariant()}>
        <p>My work</p>
        <h2>Projects.</h2>
      </motion.div>

      <div className='project w-full flex'>
        <motion.p whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }} variants={fadeIn("", "", 0.1, 1)}>
          <ul>
            {list.map((item) => (
              <ProjectList
                title={item.title}
                active={selected === item.id}
                setSelected={setSelected}
                id={item.id}
              />
            ))}
          </ul>

          <div className='box mt-20 flex flex-wrap justify-center'>
            {data.map((project, index) => (
              <div key={`project-${index}`}>
                <ProjectCard index={index} {...project} />
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        </motion.p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Project;
```

This component uses state to manage the selected project category and fetches the corresponding project data from 

index.js

. It then renders a list of 

ProjectCard

 components to display each project.

### Conclusion

This project is a well-structured React application with a focus on 3D elements and animations. It uses modern tools and libraries to create an interactive and visually appealing portfolio website.
